Estimated 2 hours to add "stamps" and "clearstamps", given that no current impleentation exists on the turtle side or the TurtleView side, and no infrastructure exists there. 
Minimum of 4 files will be changed: Turtleview/SlogoView (one of the two, not sure which one handles displaying), Turtle, and two new command node classes, one per command.
